            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Avinash S, an Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate with a strong passion for Software Engineering. I'm eager to embark on a rewarding career where I can leverage my technical skills and problem-solving abilities to contribute to innovative software development projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                My technical skills include proficiency in Java (Core Java, Collections, Threads, Exception Handling), JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I'm also experienced with frameworks like Hibernate and Spring Boot, and I'm comfortable with database management using SQL.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my academic journey at Visvesvaraya Technological University, The Oxford College of Engineering, I maintained a CGPA of 7.07. I've also enhanced my skills through a Java Full Stack Development certification from Jspiders, where I gained expertise in various technologies including JDBC, Servlets, and Spring MVC.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have hands-on experience in developing various projects, including a Library Management System, Employee and Manager Management System, Weather Application, Login Page with Firebase Authentication, and a Real-Time Weather Data Processing System. These projects have allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios and have strengthened my understanding of software development principles.
